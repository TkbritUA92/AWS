### Using AWS CLI:

Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured on your system. If not, you can install it following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

1. **Create EBS Volumes:**

   Open your terminal and use the following command to create EBS volumes:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone <availability-zone> --size <size-in-gb> --volume-type <volume-type>
   ```

   Replace `<availability-zone>` with the desired availability zone (e.g., `us-east-1a`), `<size-in-gb>` with the desired size of the volume in GiB, and `<volume-type>` with the desired volume type (e.g., `gp2` for General Purpose SSD).

   You can repeat this command to create multiple volumes with different settings or sizes.

2. **Attach Volumes to EC2 Instance:**

   After creating the volumes, you'll need to attach them to your EC2 instance. Use the following command to attach a volume:

   ```bash
   aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id <volume-id> --instance-id <instance-id> --device /dev/sdX
   ```

   Replace `<volume-id>` with the ID of the EBS volume you created, `<instance-id>` with the ID of your EC2 instance, and `/dev/sdX` with the desired device name (e.g., `/dev/xvdb`).

Repeat these steps to create and attach multiple EBS volumes to your EC2 instance as needed. Once attached, you can proceed with the RAID setup script provided earlier to configure RAID on these volumes.
